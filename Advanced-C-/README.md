# Advanced C Programming - HY255
This directory contains the source code and implementations for the Advanced C module of my coursework. The focus of this project is on low-level memory management, efficient data structures, and mastering advanced C syntax.

## Contents

- ### MemoryManagement/: Exercises involving malloc, calloc, realloc, and free.

- ### DataStructures/: Custom implementations of Linked Lists, Trees, and Hash Maps.

- ### FileIO/: Advanced file handling and binary data processing.

- ### Pointers/: Deep dives into function pointers, pointer arithmetic, and multi-dimensional arrays.

🛠️ Features & Concepts Covered
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Handling heap memory and avoiding memory leaks (checked with Valgrind).

Structures & Unions: Using complex data types to model real-world data.

Bitwise Operations: Low-level data manipulation.

Header Files & Modularization: Organizing code into .h and .c files for scalability.

Makefiles: Automated build processes for compiling multiple source files.

💻 How to Run
To compile and run any of the programs, ensure you have gcc installed.
