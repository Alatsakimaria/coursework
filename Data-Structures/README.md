# Data Structures - HY240
This directory contains my implementations of fundamental data structures. The goal of this project is to understand how data is organized, stored, and manipulated efficiently in memory.

## Key Implementations
- Dynamic Resizing: Creating data structures that grow and shrink as needed.

- Complexity Analysis: Each implementation aims for optimal Time and Space complexity.

- Memory Management: Careful use of pointers and manual memory allocation (malloc/free) to ensure no leaks.

- Abstract Data Types (ADTs): Clean separation between the interface (header files) and implementation.
