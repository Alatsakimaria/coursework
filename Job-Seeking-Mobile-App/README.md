## Redesign (2025)

As part of improving my **UI/UX design skills**, I created a complete **redesign** of two key screens from the original Job Seeking Mobile App:

### Home Screen (Job Feed)
- Refined layout hierarchy with clearer grouping for “Top Companies” and “Urgently Needed” jobs.  
- Improved typography and spacing for better readability.  
- Added consistent iconography and simplified bottom navigation.

### Job Details Screen
- Modernized interface with clear information hierarchy (salary, job type, level, etc.).  
- Designed an interactive **“Apply Job”** section with primary and secondary call-to-actions.  
- Enhanced accessibility through better contrast, spacing, and visual balance.
